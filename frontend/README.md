**How to Run Frontend Demo Locally**

### Prerequisites

Before running the demo locally, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later) or Yarn (v1.x or later)

### Steps to Run the Demo

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install all the necessary dependencies using npm or Yarn:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
   Or, if you prefer Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   Or, if you're using Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

5. **Access the Application**

   Open your web browser and navigate to:
   
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
   
   This will display the demo application locally.

### Notes

- If you encounter any issues, make sure all dependencies are installed correctly.
- For additional configurations or troubleshooting, refer to the project documentation or consult the project's issue tracker.
